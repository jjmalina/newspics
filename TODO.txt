How the app works:
1. Get the newest/most popular articles from NYT and their headline and content
2. Take the NYT article content and pass it to parsely so we can get all the topic info
3. With our list of topics, query tumblr to get images for those topics
4. Once we have all of our data, store it in the database so we can display it on the front end


test each API to see what data we get and model the API call process
set up django and celery to run the API call process periodically
design an attractive front end to show all of our stuff.


parsely publishers

usnews
bloomberg
gawker
venturebeat
betabeat
dailycaller
salon


periodically scrape muck rack and store trending topics
for each trending topic, make a request to parsely to get articles for that topic
	for each article, see if the URL is in our database, if it isn't create a new article
		for each topic in the article, get an image from tumblr and save it
		once this is complete, mark the article as ready to go
store the articles in our database
then for each article's topic, make API calls to tumblr

have one task get articles and save them with their topics
the other task queries db for articles that don't have images, then for each topic finds images
need to designate article and topic as ready
