How the app works:
1. Get the newest/most popular articles from NYT and their headline and content
2. Take the NYT article content and pass it to parsely so we can get all the topic info
3. With our list of topics, query tumblr to get images for those topics
4. Once we have all of our data, store it in the database so we can display it on the front end


test each API to see what data we get and model the API call process
set up django and celery to run the API call process periodically
design an attractive front end to show all of our stuff.
